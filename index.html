        <p> My favourite hobby is playing sports and video games. I've always loved spr=orts as a little kid especailly soccer. I think you can always get better and have fun. Being an athlete is a lot of dedication and hard work. My idol is lionel Messi, he went from a kid being told he could never grow tall. To being one of the greatest soccer players of all time. I also love vdieo games such as, Call of Duty Warzone, Call of Duty Black Ops, Madden, Fifa, Apex alegends, Hyperscape, Forza Horizon, COD mobile and more. My top three favourite sports include: Soccer, Basketball, and Badminton. P.S. I hate SWIMMING!! </p>
